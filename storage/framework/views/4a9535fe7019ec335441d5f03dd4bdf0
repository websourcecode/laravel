                    <h2>Let Caller ID name display work for you</h2>
                    <h4>Now you can boost your answer rate <i>and</i> meet regulatory requirements</h4>
                    <p><br>If you were meeting a potential client for the first time, would you hand them a business card that read <strong>UNAVAILABLE</strong> or <strong>UNKNOWN</strong>? Of course not. But that's what many call centers are displaying right now when they use a tollfree number or unmanaged DID to contact their customers.<br><br>
                     Studies show that matching your CNAM display to your call campaign can increase your answer rate. With Caller ID Management, you can keep your existing telephone service providers yet have access to numbers from throughout the lower 48 states, with CNAM tailored to your call campaign - <i>and you can even make money doing it.</i><br><br>
                        And with recent and suggested changes to the Telemarketing Sales Rule and FCC/FTC regulations, it's in every outbound call center's interest to stay ahead of the curve and maintain legal compliance.  Caller ID Name Appearance, once an exotic optional feature, is now an expected component of toll service.  Rather than approach it as a liability, why not turn it into an asset and let it work <i>for</i> you?<br><br>
                     Caller ID Management from Omega Services helps you turn a regulatory necessity into a tool to boost your answer rate and create additional revenue streams.</p><br>

                    <h2>Caller ID Management</h2>
                    <h4>Maximize campaign flexibility, maintain compliance and generate revenue</h4>
                    <div><p><br>Omega's flagship product, Caller ID Management provides nationwide DIDs on which CNAM and return call routing can be added, changed, or removed as needed via an easy-to-use online portal to provide maximum efficiency to your call campaigns.  For campaigns with particular CNAM display requests or which require callback numbers in a particular region, Caller ID Management provides the flexibility you need to maintain compliance and maximize your contact rate.<br><br>
                    CIDM participation is on a generated dip volume basis and subscribers are never charged for service.  Omega does not carry your outbound traffic, and the assigned numbers are used with your current dialer and phone company contracts.  In fact, our revenue sharing program lets you generate a second revenue stream from your existing dialing, helping to offset operating costs.<br><br>Omega not only provides you with the use of numbers in your specified target area, adjusts the CNAM listing to your specification, and routes your return call traffic back to your call center - all without charge - but we even <i>pay you</i> to use our service.</p><p><br>
