  IMPORTANT - Please be sure to TEST your number
  service prior to implementation.  Each time you make a change on the
  website, wait a few hours and then call the OMEGA number and verify that it
  rings to the 'Service Number' you input on the website.  Additionally, make
  a test call from your dialer outpulsing the Omega number to a number (NOT A
  CELL PHONE) that has caller id service and verify that the display name that
  you entered on your Omega site appears in the caller id name field.
